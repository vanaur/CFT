# Conformal Field Theory
This is the "internship report" for the first year of a master's degree in theoretical physics of fundamental interactions, the subject of which was the study (learning) of conformal field theory during four weeks (February 2025).

The document(s) has/have been written with [Typst](https://typst.app/), there is a version in the original language, French, and a version translated into English.

From WikipÃ©dia,

> A conformal field theory (CFT) is a quantum field theory that is invariant under conformal transformations. In two dimensions, there is an infinite-dimensional algebra of local conformal transformations, and conformal field theories can sometimes be exactly solved or classified.
> 
> Conformal field theory has important applications to condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, quantum statistical mechanics, and string theory. Statistical and condensed matter systems are indeed often conformally invariant at their thermodynamic or quantum critical points.
